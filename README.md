## Hosting on esp8266 (current)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNBHkGJebW0
- Need to know how to connect to global internet.
- arduino allows static-ish web page send back.
Problem: esp8266 cannot install an OS. Therefore no drivers
:/ and no fan :/

## ESP32s
https://github.com/ESP32-Work/ESP32-FreeRTOS-Webserver
mcrocontroller uses FreeRTOS OS.


# Actual hosting hardware
- Can I use the asus fan?
pwm fan controller wire, needs microusb
How to connect the asus fan to my esp32?
One idea: connecting to direct power supply runs the fans
- I want to run it in response to cpu heat/num reqs.
